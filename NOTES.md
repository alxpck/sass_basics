# Watch and compile scss dir into css dir
$ sass --watch scss:css

# Variables
Declare variables using the `$`
The convention is to use dashes to separate words.
e.g. `$color-primary: #278da4;`

Define the variable at the top of the scss file, and then reference it whenever it's needed in the file. 

What's the scope of a scss variable?
